## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a qualified actuary specializing in building high-performance actuarial calculation engines targeted the pension industry. 

Currently, I work at LÃ¦rernes Pension, where Iâ€™ve implemented a custom CLI tool for configuring and executing our day-to-day actuarial calculations.

I bring a deep understanding of actuarial mathematics and business strategy, combined with strong technical skills in software development and system architecture â€” particularly in C#, .NET, and SQL.

Iâ€™m motivated by the challenge of making complex actuarial logic accessible and actionable real-world applications.
